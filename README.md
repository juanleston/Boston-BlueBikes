# Boston Bluebikes Riding Patterns: Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic EDA and Data Visualization

This repository contains the code to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization over all of Bluebikes bike-sharing rides that occurred between January 1st 2019 and December 31st 2020. 

## Introduction

Bluebikes is a bike-sharing system that operates in the Boston Metro Area and surrounding communities. It consists of a fleet of bikes that are distributed in the city across a network of docking stations. Users can unlock bikes from one station and return them at any other station which makes the service useful for one-way trips.

The bike-sharing system has succesfully grown since its opening in 2011 and has become a vital commuting method for many Boston residents, which rely on it to move around the city without dealing with the hassle of using public transportation or owning a vehicle in highly populated areas.

The motivation to perform this project is because as a resident of Boston, the service has personally become one of my preferred methods to perform short commutes around the busy city. In that sense, the goal of this project is to understand at a broad scale the program's operation and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected it.
