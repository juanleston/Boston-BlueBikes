# Boston-BlueBikes Riding Patterns: Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic EDA and Data Visualization

This repository contains the code to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization over all the bike sharing rides that occurred between January 1st 2019 and December 31st 2020. Being a resident of Boston, the Bluebikes bike sharing service has personally become one of my preferred methods to perform short commutes around the busy city. In that sense, the general goal of this project is to identify how the COVID-19 Pandemic changed riding patterns and from those findings come up with recommendations for the service provider.
